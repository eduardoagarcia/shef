## Creating Recipes

To create your own recipes:

1. Create your user directory: `mkdir -p ~/.shef/user` (if it does not already exist)
2. Create a new YAML file: `touch ~/.shef/user/my-recipes.yaml`
3. Build and develop your recipes following the instructions above
4. Run `shef ls` to see your new recipes
