## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Recipe not found**

- Check if you're using the correct name and category
- Use `shef ls` to see available recipes
- Check your recipe file syntax

**Command fails with unexpected output**

- Remember all commands run through a shell, so shell syntax applies
- Escape special characters in command strings
- Use the `transform` field to format output

**Prompt validation errors**

- Ensure minimum/maximum values are within range
- Check that file paths exist and have correct extensions
- Verify select options contain the default value
