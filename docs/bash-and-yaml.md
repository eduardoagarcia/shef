## Bash Scripts and Shef: Complementary Tools

Bash scripting is a powerful and valid approach for shell automation. Shef isn't designed to replace bash scripts, but
rather provides a toolkit that compliments bash when you need specific features.

Shef implements some common tooling like built-in support for interactive prompts, conditional logic, and command
piping. This structured approach can simplify certain tasks that might require more verbose code in bash.

Consider Shef as another tool in your automation toolkit. Absolutely use bash scripts when they're the right fit, and
reach for Shef when its features align with your specific needs.

## Ugh. YAML? Really?

Yep. Another config format. I considered several options, and YAML emerged as the most practical choice for this
particular use case. JSON lacks comments and multiline string support, which are essential when defining shell commands
and documenting workflows. XML would have been unnecessarily verbose. TOML, while nice, doesn't handle nested structures
as elegantly for complex workflows.
