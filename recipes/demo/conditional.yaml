      This recipe demonstrates conditional operations based on user input.

      The recipe will:
        1. Prompt you to select a fruit (Apples or Oranges)
        2. Execute a specific operation based on your selection

      This shows how to use the "condition" property to run operations only when
      specific conditions are met.

      Key concepts:
        - Prompts for user input
        - Conditional execution based on variables
        - Using variable values in conditions
    operations:
      - name: "Choose Fruit"
        id: "choose"
        command: 'echo "You selected: {{ .fruit }}"'
        prompts:
          - name: "Fruit Select"
            id: "fruit"
            type: "select"
            message: "Choose a fruit:"
            options:
              - "Apples"
              - "Oranges"

      - name: "Apple Operation"
        id: "apple"
        command: echo "This is the apple operation! üçé"
        condition: .fruit == "Apples"

      - name: "Orange Operation"
        id: "orange"
        command: echo "This is the orange operation! üçä"
        condition: .fruit == "Oranges"
