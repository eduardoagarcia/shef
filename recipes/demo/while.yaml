      This recipe demonstrates the 'while' loop control flow in Shef.

      The recipe simulates:
        1. A service performing work
        2. Checking the status on each iteration
        3. Completing when the status changes (after 3 seconds)

      While loop parameters:
        - type: "while"       # Specifies the while loop control flow
        - condition: expr     # Expression that must be true for the loop to continue
        - progres_mode: true  # Update output inline to show progress

      This shows:
        - How to define a while loop with a condition
        - How to access the current duration (seconds and millisecond format)
        - How to change the condition to exit the loop
    operations:
      - name: "Loop While Status is Running"
        control_flow:
          type: "while"
          condition: .duration_s < 3
          progress_mode: true
        operations:
          - name: "Status Update"
            command: echo {{ color "yellow" (printf "Performing work... '%s'" .duration_ms_fmt) }}

      - name: "Show Completion"
        command: echo {{ color "green" "While loop finished - work is complete!" }}
