      This recipe demonstrates the 'while' loop control flow in Shef.

      The recipe simulates:
        1. A service running for a number of iterations
        2. Checking the status on each iteration
        3. Completing when the status changes (after 3 iterations)

      While loop parameters:
        - type: "while"    # Specifies the while loop control flow
        - condition: expr  # Expression that must be true for the loop to continue

      This shows:
        - How to define a while loop with a condition
        - How to access the current iteration count
        - How to change the condition to exit the loop
    operations:
      - name: "Loop While Status is Running"
        control_flow:
          type: "while"
          condition: .complete == "false"
        operations:
          - name: "Perform Work"
            command: echo {{ color "yellow" "Service is running, performing work..." }}

          - name: "Sleep"
            command: sleep 1

          - name: "Status Check"
            id: "complete"
            command: echo "{{ if ge .iteration 3 }}true{{ else }}false{{ end }}"
            silent: true

      - name: "Show Completion"
        command: echo {{ color "green" "While loop finished - service is no longer running!" }}
