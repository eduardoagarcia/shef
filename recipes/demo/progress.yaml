    help: |
      This recipe demonstrates how to use progress bars, pre-defined variables, and working directories.

      The recipe will:
        1. Prompt for confirmation before creating temporary files
        2. Create a set number of temporary files with a progress bar
        3. Count and display the number of files created
        4. Delete each file with a customized progress bar
        5. Clean up the working directory

      Key features demonstrated:
        - Pre-defined variables using the `vars` section
        - Setting a working directory with `workdir`
        - Using the `count` function to count items
        - Progress bars with different configurations and themes
        - For loops with progress tracking
        - ForEach loops with progress tracking
        - Color-coded output for better readability

      This recipe is useful for:
        - Understanding how to use the vars, workdir, and count features
        - Seeing how progress bars can be customized
