      This recipe demonstrates how to use colors and text styles in Shef recipes.

      Color Functions:
        {{ color "colorname" "text" }}  # Colorizes text
        {{ style "stylename" "text" }}  # Applies style to text

      Available Colors:
        - black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white
        - bg-black, bg-red, bg-green, bg-yellow, bg-blue, bg-magenta, bg-cyan, bg-white

      Available Styles:
        - bold, dim, italic, underline

      Colors and styles can be combined:
        {{ style "bold" (color "blue" "text") }}

      The NO_COLOR environment variable disables all colors.
    operations:
      - name: "Basic color example"
        command: echo "{{ color "green" "This text is green" }} and {{ color "red" "this is red" }}"

      - name: "Style examples"
        command: |
          echo {{ style "bold" "This text is bold" }}
          echo {{ style "italic" "This text is italic" }}
          echo {{ style "underline" "This text is underlined" }}
          echo {{ style "dim" "This text is dimmed" }}

      - name: "Combined colors and styles"
        command: |
          echo {{ style "bold" (color "blue" "This is bold blue text") }}
          echo {{ color "black" (color "bg-yellow" "Black text on yellow background") }}

      - name: "Multiple styles"
        command: echo {{ style "bold" (style "underline" "This is bold and underlined") }}

      - name: "Color in command output"
        command: echo "Running {{ color "cyan" "important ls -la" }} command..." && ls -la

      - name: "Color in conditionals"
        id: "status_check"
        command: echo "status:ok"
        transform: |
          {{ if contains .output "ok" }}
          {{ color "green" (style "bold" "✓ Status check passed") }}
          {{ else }}
          {{ color "red" (style "bold" "✗ Status check failed") }}
          {{ end }}
