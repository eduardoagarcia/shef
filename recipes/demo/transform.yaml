      This recipe demonstrates data transformation and pipeline flow in Shef.

      The recipe:
        1. Generates a list of items
        2. Filters the list for items containing "a"
        3. Displays filtered results in green
        4. Filters the list for items containing "her"
        5. Displays filtered results in yellow

      This showcases:
        - Passing data between operations
        - Using the filter template function
        - Accessing output from previous operations
        - Formatting output with colors
        - Silent operations for intermediate processing
    operations:
      - name: "Generate a Simple List"
        id: "generate"
        command: |
          echo "apple
          banana
          cherry
          dragonfruit
          eggplant"

      - name: "Filter 'a' Items"
        id: "filter_a"
        command: cat
        transform: '{{ filter .generate "a" }}'
        silent: true

      - name: "Display 'a' Results"
        id: "display_a"
        command: echo "Items containing 'a':\n{{ color "green" .filter_a }}"

      - name: "Filter 'her' Items"
        id: "filter_her"
        command: cat
        transform: '{{ filter .generate "her" }}'
        silent: true

      - name: "Display 'her' Results"
        id: "display_her"
        command: echo "Items containing 'her':\n{{ color "yellow" .filter_her }}"
