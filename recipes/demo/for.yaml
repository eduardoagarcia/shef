      Demonstrates the 'for' loop control flow with a fixed number of iterations.

      Usage:
        shef demo for                     # Run a loop with 5 iterations
    operations:
      - name: "Run a For Loop"
        control_flow:
          type: "for"
          count: 5
          variable: "i"
        operations:
          - name: "Print Iteration"
            command: echo "Running iteration {{ color "yellow" .iteration }}"
            id: "last_iteration"

      - name: "Show Completion"
        command: 'echo "{{ color "green" "For loop completed!" }} Last iteration ran: {{ .last_iteration }}"'
