      This recipe demonstrates the 'for' loop control flow in Shef.

      The recipe runs a loop for a fixed number of iterations (5), showing:
        - How to define a for loop with a set count
        - How to access the current iteration count
        - How to use color formatting within the loop
        - How to access the output of operations in the loop after completion

      For loop parameters:
        - type: "for"       # Specifies the for loop control flow
        - count: n          # Number of iterations to run
        - variable: "name"  # Variable name to store the current iteration number
    operations:
      - name: "Run a For Loop"
        control_flow:
          type: "for"
          count: 5
          variable: "i"
        operations:
          - name: "Print Iteration"
            command: echo "Running iteration {{ color "yellow" .iteration }}"
            id: "last_iteration"

      - name: "Show Completion"
        command: 'echo "{{ color "green" "For loop completed!" }} Last iteration ran: {{ .last_iteration }}"'
