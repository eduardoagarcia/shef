      This recipe demonstrates how to use reusable components in Shef.

      The recipe will:
        1. Use the "health-check" component to gather system information
        2. Display the collected information in a formatted report
        3. Show how components can be nested (health-check uses system-info)

      Components are reusable blocks of operations that can be shared across recipes:
        - Components are defined with an "id" that you reference with "uses"
        - Component operations with IDs become available as variables
        - Components can use other components (nesting)
        - Operations inside components work just like regular operations

      Key concepts:
        - Creating modular, reusable operation sets
        - Breaking complex workflows into logical components
        - Referencing component outputs by their operation IDs
        - Building higher-level components from simpler ones
    operations:
      - name: "Run System Checkup"
        uses: "health-check"

      - name: "Generate System Report"
        command: |
          echo "==== SYSTEM INFO ===="
          echo "Hostname: {{ .hostname }}"
          echo "User: {{ .user }}"
          echo "Time: {{ .datetime }}"
          echo "Disk Usage: {{ .disk_space }}"

  - id: "system-info"
