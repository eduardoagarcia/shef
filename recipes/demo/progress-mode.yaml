    help: |
      This recipe demonstrates the 'progress_mode' feature in different control flows.

      Progress mode allows operations within loops to update in-place on a single line,
      making it perfect for displaying progress indicators, counters, or status updates
      without cluttering your terminal with multiple lines of output.

      The recipe shows progress_mode in three different control flow types:
        - for loop: Counts through iterations with a numeric counter
        - foreach loop: Processes items from a collection with updated status
        - while loop: Shows a running timer that updates in real-time

      Usage in control_flow:
        progress_mode: true  # Enables inline updates for all operations in the loop

      Each loop's output replaces the previous output on the same line rather than
      printing on new lines, creating a cleaner, more dynamic display of progress
      information.
    operations:
      - name: "For Progress Mode"
        control_flow:
          type: "for"
          count: 500
          variable: "i"
          progress_mode: true
        operations:
          - name: "Print Iteration"
            command: echo "Running iteration... {{ color "green" .iteration }}"

      - name: "Foreach Progress Mode"
        control_flow:
          type: "foreach"
          collection: "Item 1\nItem 2\nItem 3\nItem 4\nItem 5"
          as: "item"
          progress_mode: true
        operations:
          - name: "Print Item"
            command: echo {{ color "magenta" (printf "Processing... '%s'" .item) }}

      - name: "While Progress Mode"
        control_flow:
          type: "while"
          condition: .duration_s < 5
          progress_mode: true
        operations:
          - name: "Print Duration"
            command: echo {{ color "yellow" (printf "Build is running... '%s'" .duration_ms_fmt) }}
